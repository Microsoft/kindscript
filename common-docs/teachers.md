# Features for Teachers

This is a list of lesser known features that teachers have found useful when using MakeCode.

## Printing and Snapshots

If you want to include examples of code in printed materials, there are two good ways to do this:

### Printing

In the editor, you can print the current project you are working with by clicking the cogwheel in the top right corner and selecting `Print`.
This will produce a view of the code from your project that is printer friendly.

### Snapshot

You can save a ``.png`` file with an image of all the blocks in your current projects using the ``Snapshot`` feature.
Right click on the workspace (or press and hold on touch devices), and select "Snapshot".

## Sharing

You can create links to share your project using the ``Share`` project in the top left corner of the editor.

### Embed

If you have a class website that supports posting ``HTML``, you can embed the simulator, code, or the full editor from the share screen.

## Tutorials

Tutorials are examples that guide students through creating a program step by step,
with features and blocks limited to focus on what is most important.
Typically, the first examples on the home page are tutorials,
to help introduce students to the concepts they need to write simple programs.
