## Where are my projects saved?

Projects are kept in the browser's local indexed data store. You can save your project with a name. If you don't name your project, it's kept as an "Untitled" project. Read more about [saving](/save-project) projects.

## Can I use MakeCode when I'm not connected to the internet? #work-offline

Yes, when MakeCode first loads in the browser, it tells the browser to download the files it needs to work locally. If you later want to add a package to use with your program, you will need to connect again. See the page about using MakeCode [offline](/offline).

## What happens when I clear the browser's cache and temporary files? #clear-data

When you clear browsing data, all of the saved projects and files that support MakeCode working offline are removed. Any project that you've shared to the public cloud is still there.

## Where does a project that I share go? #sharing

When you share a project it's saved to the public cloud for MakeCode. Anyone can see your project if they have it's shared URL.
