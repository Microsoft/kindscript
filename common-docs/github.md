# GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com) is a popular web site used by developers to host and work together on code. Using the GitHub integration in MakeCode, you can seamlessly and **freely** host your programs and collaborate with friends on them.

To use GitHub, you need a [creating an account](https://github.com/) and internet access.
You do not need special knowledge beyond what you've learned in MakeCode so far.

Let's start discovering GitHub by explaining a usage common scenario: you are editing your own project and use GitHub to save your changes.

### Step 1 Create a repository

A **repository** is used to organize a single project. Repositories will contain all the files needed for your MakeCode projects.

* open the editor @homeurl@, create a new project and switch to the JavaScript view.
* click on the **create GitHub repository** button under the simulator
* select a good name and descriptions (it helps with internet searches!)

### ~ hint

If you haven't signed in yet with GitHub, you will need to get a **developer token**. We have a [detailed guide](/github/token) on how to get this token to get signed in.

If you cannot see this button, try to sign in into GitHub first. Go to the gearwheel menu, click on **Extensions** and **Log In to GitHub**. Once your token is entered, it should be visible.

### Step 2 Make and commit changes

Once the repository is created, the **create GitHub repository** button will display
the name of the repository you just created. 
Make a random change in the code editor and you will notice that an up arrow is displayed
on the button. The arrow means some changes stored on your computer need to be uploaded to GitHub. Click on that button.

You will see a **commit changes** button and a list of **diffs** under. A **commit** is a bundled set of changes that can be uploaded to GitHub [Read more...](/github/commit). A **diff** is a common jargon used by developer to describe a widget that shows the differences between two pieces of text [Read more](/diff). Look at the diff carefully, it tells you which lines you added, deleted or modified.

### ~ hint

It's always a good idea to review changes you made to your code before committing them!

Click on the **commit changes** button to upload these changes to GitHub. 

### Step 3 Make and revert changes

Go back (there's a **go back** button) to the code editor and make another change. Click on the GitHub view to see the diffs of your changes.

You will notice a **Revert** button next to the modified file. It allows to undo all the changes in that file and roll it back to the content in the previous commit.

Click on **Revert** to see how it works.
