# Private Assignments

This section describes a methodology to manage assignment via GitHub. 
Each assigment is a **private repository** under the student account; where the teacher has been given **collaborator** access.
The student does his work in a **branch** and returns his work by creating a **pull request** with the teacher as **reviewer**.

This methodology is very close to the way professional developers use GitHub.

#### Public repositories

Using **public** repositories simplifies a lot the configuration phase of the assignments.
If it is acceptable for the code to be publically available on https://github.com, 
we recommend using the [public assignments](/github/public-assignments).

## Step 1: Students create a new private repository 

From the MakeCode editor, the student create a **private** repository for the assignment that will be hosted under their account (**Make sure to select private!**). Students should all name the repository with the assignment name (e.g. "homework" in this example).

### Step 2: Student invite teacher as collaborator

The student will have to invite the teacher as **collaborator**.

* open the **collaborators** page using the collaborator button
* enter the teacher alias in the textbox and send the invitation. 
* the teacher needs to accept the invitation to get access to the private repository

#### GitHub and 404

If you try the invitation link and it gives you a **404** error, it most likely means that you are not signed in with GitHub.

## Step 3: Student change, commit, push cycle

It's time to work! Student can do all their work and use the **commit & push** button to save their work. It is a good idea to encourage them to commit whenever they feel
they have made progress and always provide a meaningful description of the changes.

## Step 4: Teacher reviews the commit history

The teacher can use the [MakeCode GitHub Explorer](https://makecode.com/github-explorer) browse the repositories of a user easily. If needed the teacher can also review the entire history of the project on GitHub.

## Step 5: (optional) Student makes the repository public

If the student wants to add this project to his portfolio, he can simply make it public and it will be visible on his GitHub user page.
