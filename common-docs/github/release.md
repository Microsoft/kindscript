# GitHub Releases

If you plan to reuse your repository in other projects as an extension, you will have to create releases.

Releases mark a specific point in your repository's history and allow you to publish your extension
to other users when you think your changes are ready.

## Versioning #versioning

In MakeCode, the 3 numbers in the extension versions have a special meaning. It follows a common scheme called [semver](https://semver.org/)

Whenever, you see a version number like **1.3.19**,
it really means **major** version is 1, **minor**
version is 3 and patch number is **19**.

The rules of semver are, given a version number ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH``, increment the:

* ``MAJOR`` version when you make incompatible API changes,
* ``MINOR`` version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
* ``PATCH`` version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

## License #license

You can include an open source license in your repository to make it easier for other people to contribute.
