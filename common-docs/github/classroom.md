# Classroom

This page describes various ways to use the GitHub integration to create and collect assignments.

This section assumes that all students were able to register an account in https://github.com.

## Assignments as repositories

Students can create new repositories, public or private, for each assignments. Repositories provides a full tracability of the changes, collaboration features and precise access control for the teachers.

There are different ways to use repositories, in order of complexity:

* [public assignments](/github/public-assignments) using public repositories. Easy to setup but code is public.
* [private assignments](/github/private-assignments) using private repositories. More setup steps but code is only visible to student and teacher.
* [GitHub classroom](https://classroom.github.com) provides an integrated classroom management system that automates a lot of the repository creation steps.
