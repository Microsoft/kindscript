# Public assignments

This section describes a methodology to manage assignment via GitHub. 
Each assigment is a **public repository** under the student account.

Let's illustrate it for a **homework** asignment.

### Step 1: Students create a new public repository 

From the MakeCode editor, the student create a **public** repository for the assignment that will be hosted under their account. Students should all name the repository with the assignment name (e.g. "homework" in this example).

### Step 2: Student change, commit, push cycle

It's time to work! Student can do all their work and use the **commit & push** button to save their work. It is a good idea to encourage them to commit whenever they feel
they have made progress and always provide a meaningful description of the changes.

### Step 3: Teacher reviews the commit history

The teacher can use the [MakeCode GitHub Explorer](https://makecode.com/github-explorer) browse the repositories of a user easily. If needed the teacher can also review the entire history of the project on GitHub.
