Hello MakeCoders!
As you may recall, last May, we announced Microsoft MakeCode for Minecraft: Education Edition.
Much of your feedback from that release asked us to expand our support to other versions of Minecraft, so that students can code Minecraft at home as well at school.  Today, the Microsoft MakeCode team is happy to announce the availability of MakeCode for Minecraft for Windows 10, a version of Minecraft for anyone with a Windows 10 computer.

Here‚Äôs what you need to get started:

* Minecraft for Windows 10 - available from the Windows Store.  If you already have it, just make sure you download the latest game updates
* Code Connection app ‚Äì available to download from the Minecraft Education page.  You‚Äôll need to save the install file on your computer, and double-click to run it.

With this latest update, we‚Äôve also taken the opportunity to fix a bunch of bugs and add some new features that people have suggested to us.  We‚Äôll also be removing the Beta label, so from now on we‚Äôll try to keep our updates minimal to avoid impacting teachers/classrooms during the academic school year and will only release major updates during the summer months.  

Here‚Äôs a run-down of all the new goodies in this release:

**Home Page** ‚Äì we got a lot of feedback saying that throwing new users directly into the editor was not a great experience, and the sample projects and tutorials were too hidden.  So having this ‚ÄúHome‚Äù page is an effort to fix that.

**Block UI update** ‚Äì you may notice that our blocks look slightly different.  We‚Äôve ported MakeCode over from vanilla Blockly to the new Scratch Blocks UI (which is a combo of Blockly & Scratch).  There are some nice improvements with this new rendering, notably:

* Bigger blocks which makes it easier for users with touchscreen devices to drag and drop with their finger, and more efficient use of block space

* Different shapes for different data types ‚Äì specifically boolean values (true/false) are hexagon shapes, and numbers and text are round

* Better indication of where blocks fit together

**More Blocks and Items** ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the slime/pumpkin/cake?‚Äù this was the most frequent question we got from students.  So, we‚Äôre happy to say we‚Äôve added support for more game objects, and a handy Search bar to find what you need.

**Simplified Toolbox** ‚Äì we removed the ‚ÄúMore‚Ä¶‚Äù subcategories from the Toolbox and instead tried to reduce the number of blocks we show, and group them in more meaningful ways.  We also added Functions, Arrays and Builder categories under the Advanced section.

**On Chat Command** ‚Äì we made it more intuitive to add arguments/parameters to the On Chat Command block by using a ‚Äú+‚Äù button.

**More Tutorials & Examples** ‚Äì I won‚Äôt lie, it was a lot of fun making these new tutorials and example projects üòä.  Try the Bouncing Pigs, Raining Cats & Dogs, or the Agent Checkerboard!
