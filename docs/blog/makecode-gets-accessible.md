**Posted on September 8th, 2017 by [microsoftsam](https://github.com/microsoftsam) and [veler](https://github.com/veler)**

In line with Microsoft’s mission to empower every person on the planet to achieve more, the MakeCode team is proud to announce accessibility support for the micro:bit today.  According to the National Center for Education Statistics ([NCES](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_cgg.asp)) in the United States 13% of all public school students receive Special Education services. And in the UK, 18% of students have Special Education Needs according to the [Department of Education](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/children-with-special-educational-needs-an-analysis-2013). We’re committed to ensuring  that Microsoft MakeCode is designed for students of all abilities, and today is a first step in that journey.

Some of the accessibility features we have released today include:

## Keyboard Navigation

Students can use the Tab key to navigate through menus and controls on the page.

Vision impaired students can use screen readers, such as [Narrator](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/22798/windows-10-narrator-get-started), for audio support. The JavaScript editor offer additional features for assistive technologies.
