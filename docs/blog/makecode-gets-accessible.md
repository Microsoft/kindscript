**Posted on September 8th, 2017 by [microsoftsam](https://github.com/microsoftsam) and [veler](https://github.com/veler)**

In keeping with Microsoft’s mission to empower every person on the planet to achieve more, today, the MakeCode team is pleased to announce accessibility support for the [micro:bit](https://makecode.microbit.org). According to the National Center for Education Statistics ([NCES](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_cgg.asp)), 13% of all public school students in the United States receive Special Education services. And in the UK, 18% of students have Special Education Needs according to the [Department for Education](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/children-with-special-educational-needs-an-analysis-2013). We’re committed to ensuring that Microsoft MakeCode is designed for students of all abilities, and today is a first step in that journey.

Some of the accessibility features we have released today include:

## Keyboard navigation

Students can use the **Tab** key to navigate through menus and controls on the page.

## Assistive technologies

Vision impaired students can use screen readers, such as [Narrator](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/22798/windows-10-narrator-get-started), for audible navigation and identification of visual elements. The JavaScript editor also offers additional features for assistive technologies.

## High contrast

High contrast mode helps low-vision students locate and distinguish between the different visual elements in the MakeCode editor.
