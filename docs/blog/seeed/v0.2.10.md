# Microsoft MakeCode for Seeed Grove Zero Beta

**Posted on November 14, 2017 by [riknoll](https://github.com/riknoll)**

The Microsoft MakeCode Team is excited to announce the [beta release](https://makecode.seeedstudio.com/)
of an editor for the [Seeed Grove Zero](https://www.seeedstudio.com/edu/grove-zero.html) system!

Grove Zero is made up of magnetic modules that snap together for endless possibilities. Program
the main board to control all of the various inputs and outputs out of the box. The magnetic connectors
can even be replaced with cables for extra-flexible making opportunities! Check out the
included instruction guide for sample projects, ideas, and makes.

## The Simulator

Our Grove Zero simulator changes with the code you write! Modules show up when you
use them and hide away when you don't. To control a module, all you have to do
is select it in the bottom carousel and an easy-to-use control will appear up top.


## Powered by UF2 and CODAL

The Grove Zero ships with the [UF2 bootloader](https://makecode.com/blog/one-chip-to-flash-them-all)
so there's no install required. Running your code simply requires a computer with
a USB port and a browser. Also under-the-hood is the powerful [Lancaster University CODAL](https://github.com/lancaster-university/codal) runtime
which brings the friendly event-based programming you've come to expect from our editors.
