# Microsoft MakeCode Arcade

**Posted on January 18, 2019 by XYZ*

[Microsoft MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.microsoft.com) 
is a web-based beginner-friendly code editor to create retro arcade games 
for the web and for dedicated hardware.
As usual with MakeCode, you can 
either use blocks or JavaScript to build your program in your browser.
There's nothing to install - the games will just work in the browser!
For even more fun, you'll be
able to build your own Arcade-compatible game systems or buy them from
our hardware partners.
But just to make it clear - this time around hardware is optional, and you
can get started playing or teaching using only a computer with a web-browser.

###  What's in MakeCode Arcade?

MakeCode Arcade supports a 160x120 screen showing 16 colors at a time
(you can change the palette though!),
a 4-channel retro-appropriate sound system,
and a grand total of eight buttons (4 directions, A, B, MENU and RESET).

The microcontrollers powering handheld devices we use have similar amount of RAM
to the computers in the 1980s, so high-resolution graphics is difficult.
They are, however, around 1000x faster, so we designed an easy to use and modern
programming environment to build the games in.

Arcade features an incredibly fast on-ramp - just throw a few blocks together and
get a simple game.
As users learn, they can use our full-featured JavaScript editor with auto-completion
and other goodies, to develop arbitrarily complex games.
They can also look under the hood, at the game APIs making extensive use of 
classes, interfaces, higher order functions, fixed point arithmetic, and garbage collection.

This facilitates learning of modern programming concepts, without worrying about
high fidelity graphics or sound, while still being fun and engaging.

Arcade comes with a 2D game engine with sprites, platformer-style collisions, 
tile maps, particle systems and more.

### Sprite Editor and Gallery

A major part of the fun of Arcade is designing your sprites. 
To make this easier, Arcade has a sprite editor 
along with a gallery of specially designed sprites for your use:

The sprite editor is available both from the Blocks and JavaScript editors.
