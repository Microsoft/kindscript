# MakeCode Arcade Game Jam

![Arcade Game Jam banner](TODO)

Over the last few weeks you may have seen us posting about the MakeCode Arcade One Room Game Jam on Twitter, or talking about it on our livestreams. Well, submissions are in, and we've been delighted and amazed by the creativity and craft on display in these games! Participants were asked to make a game using exactly one tilemap, that takes place in "one room". Here are some of our favorites from the jam:

### NineCarpets by phillowcompiler

NineCarpets is a fun pattern-matching game with great graphics, in the style of a tile-sliding puzzle! Use the A button to flip a tile, B to swap two tiles, and pet the cat if you're feeling stressed about time.

### Meteor Defense! by Fieldronix

Gigantic Castle is an action platformer with multiple ways to play.
Choose between two different paths as you navigate a castle stocked with terrifying ghosts, monsters, spikes, and potted plants.
This game is a great example of level-design done well!
