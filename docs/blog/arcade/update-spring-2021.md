## MakeCode Arcade Spring Update

**Posted on March 2Xth, 2020 by [Jaqster](https://github.com/jaqster)**

I know we just released a major update to Arcade in January, but we couldn’t resist tacking on a few more things! So, we have a small spring update for you. Here’s what it includes:

New Learning Path UI updates As you recall in December, we also released the Game Maker Guide (https://arcade.makecode.com/--skillmap) which was a new format for a series of tutorial activities which build upon each other. We’ve updated the user interface for this experience to make it look more like a fun, game-based learning path. This is still a work-in-progress, so we’d love to hear your thoughts! Click the Feedback tab on the page to let us know what you think, or post in the Forum (https://forum.makecode.com).

## Immersive Reader and Color Labels

We made a couple accessibility improvements in this release. First, we got some good feedback from some of our color-blind users that the color palette in the Image Editor was not easy for them to use, as we had the color numbers listed in the tooltip, but not the actual color names. So we’ve added the color names to the tooltip labels – which makes things clear for everyone!

[Microsoft Immersive Reader](https://education.microsoft.com/en-us/resource/9b010288) is a fantastic tool to help students with reading comprehension by adding the ability to change colors, themes, font size, spacing, highlight parts of speech and read aloud among many other capabilities. MakeCode Arcade tutorial instructions are now available in this format by clicking on the Immersive Reader icon at the top of any tutorial.

## Gallery Filters

We get a lot of great feedback about all the cool sprites and images in the Gallery, but we also hear that it’s hard to find images with our gallery continuing to grow. So, we’ve added a Filtering option that allows you to filter the gallery by the different types of sprites or images:

## Block Sorting

For those of you writing very large games, we’ve implement a better block sorting algorithm when you click to Format Code on your workspace. We had already added the ability to collapse your blocks, which helps with organizing the code on your workspace, and now when you right-click on the workspace, and select Format Code, your code blocks will be sorted such that On Start is first followed by blocks that are from the same categories grouped together.
