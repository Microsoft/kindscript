# Hello 2018!

Wow, hard to believe it’s 2018 already.

The Microsoft MakeCode team is just over a year old, and we are crawling fast!

## What's new for this year?

We’re announcing some very cool stuff to kick off the new year:

### 1 - MakeCode for Wonder Workshop’s Cue Robot

Last summer our team started talking with our good friends at Wonder Workshop and then went down to visit them in sunny California. We began working together on a coding experience for their new [Cue robot](https://www.makewonder.com/cue_the_cleverbot), and today, we’re incredibly happy to announce the new [Cue Education app](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=532540&mstoken=C63JX-6GYWT-KJJ7F-3473Q-WX4YZ) available in the Windows Store based on Microsoft MakeCode. This was our first foray into robotics and we learned a lot from the [WW Team](https://www.makewonder.com/about). For more details on MakeCode for Cue, check out this post.

### 2 - Introduction to Computer Science with MakeCode for Minecraft

![Intro to CS course page](/static/blog/bett/intro-to-cs.jpg)

The amazing teaching duo, [Douglas and Mary Kiang](https://minecraft.makecode.com/courses/csintro/about/authors) have just published a new semester-long course targeted at middle school students and is based on MakeCode for Minecraft. The course is freely available [online](https://minecraft.makecode.com/courses/csintro) and as a [OneNote Notebook](https://1drv.ms/o/s!AmMIW5Hxi0RtgYNcWD5CLMgG64SnyQ). Each lesson contains unplugged activities, guided coding activities, and an independent project that maps to CSTA standards. Students learn Computer Science concepts such as variables, iteration, and conditionals while creating programs that spawn parrots, automate the Agent to chop down trees, and mine for gold and diamonds! 

We are also experimenting with a streaming video channel on [Mixer](https://mixer.com/MakeCode), where we’ll record a live coding session in Minecraft every Friday – so bookmark us and tune in!

### 3 - MakeCode for micro:bit Windows 10 app

Our very first MakeCode editor was for the [micro:bit](http://microbit.org/) which really pioneered the all-in-one educational microcontroller board. Today, we are excited to announce a [MakeCode for micro:bit](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PJC7SV48LCX) Windows 10 app available today which adds some new features and capabilities:

* One-click Download – no more dragging and dropping files to deploy your programs.  With the app, you can just click the Download button and watch the magic happen!
* Serial data – want to measure the acceleration, light level, or temperature from your micro:bit? Now you can, with our new serial data visualizer which plots values in a chart, and allows you to export the data to Excel.

## Great things are happening!

In addition to these announcements, we are seeing some great results and momentum around physical computing as a more inclusive approach to Computer Science education.  Last year, the BBC published a [national survey](http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2017/microbit-first-year) of students in the UK, and found a 70% increase in girls interested in studying computer science after having used the micro:bit.

For more information about the benefits of physical computing in education, please read this [whitepaper](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AmMIW5Hxi0RtgYNj1I2ReFGq7QIfhg) by researchers Steve Hodges and Sue Sentence. They outline seven positive outcomes of physical computing including increased creativity, learning by doing, and a more holistic view of computing education among others.

In 2017 we also spent a lot of time with teachers and students in order to learn from them, and better understand how they’re using MakeCode in their classrooms. Here’s one example: [Lufkin Independent School District](http://www.lufkinisd.org/) is located in a rural area of east Texas. [Rafranz Davis](http://rafranzdavis.com/) is the Executive Director of Professional and Digital Learning for the district and is passionate about using technology to support transformative learning experiences for all students.

Thanks to the wonderful partners, passionate teachers, and enthusiastic students for inspiring us every day.

We love waking up every morning to come to work because of you!

If you’re planning to be at [BETT](https://www.bettshow.com/) in London this week, you can find us hanging out with our partners – Wonder Workshop, Minecraft, and The Micro:bit Foundation.

We’re looking forward to moving from a fast crawl to walking upright in 2018!

– The MakeCode Team
