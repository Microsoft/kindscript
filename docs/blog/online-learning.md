# Online Learning Resources

**Posted on March 10th, 2020**

Many schools have closed or might soon close to help prevent the spread of illness. Educators may need to find ways to promote and continue learning for students without a classroom. We thought that it might be helpful to again highlight the learning resources we have with MakeCode that support online learning.

## Live Streaming from the MakeCode team & Community

To help families with school closures, the MakeCode team will be streaming daily, Monday through Friday,
on how to learn coding using MakeCode editors. All streams will be recorded and available in the [MakeCode YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCye7YlvFUUQ1dSy0WZZ1T_Q).

## Assignments and classroom management

### Microsoft Teams Assignments

**Microsoft Teams** is a collaboration hub for Office 365 where Educators can organize student groups into classes with content, conversations, apps, and assignments all in one place.

You can now create MakeCode programming assignments for your students by attaching a MakeCode project. Students can then open the MakeCode editor and complete the assignment without ever leaving Teams!
