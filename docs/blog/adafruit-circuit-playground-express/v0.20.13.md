# Adafruit Circuit Playground Express Editore v0.20.13

**Posted on November 13, 2017 by [pelikhan](https://github.com/pelikhan)**

We are very excited to remove the ``beta`` label from https://makecode.adafruit.com .
This update brings **Scratch** style rendering of the blocks, better support for assistive technologies, a console view and a [many](https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt/commits/master) [many](https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt-common-packages/commits/master) [many](https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt-adafruit/commits/master) fixes.


## Beta -> Stable

The editor is now out of ``beta`` into a stable state. You should not expect any API change or major UI change until the next school calendar year.

## Scratch Blocks

In this release, we have re-vamped the look of our blocks and aligned with **Scratch**. 
We've based our open source Blockly fork (pxt-blockly) against [scratch-blocks](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-blocks).

## Assistive technologies and High constrast

Vision impaired students can use screen readers, such as Narrator, for audible navigation and identification of visual elements. The JavaScript editor also offers additional features for assistive technologies.

High contrast mode helps low-vision students locate and distinguish between the different visual elements in the MakeCode editor.

## Console Output

The new [console](https://makecode.adafruit.com/reference/console) blocks can be used to log text or stream values to our new console output viewer. You can visualize data from the simulator or from the Circuit Playground Express itself using our [Windows App](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/makecode-for-adafruit/9pgzhwsk0pgd).

## A few API changes

As we moved out of the beta phase, we decided to make a few simplification to some of the APIs available for the Circuit Playground Express.

## ~ hint

 **All your scripts should still work!** We have [automatic upgrade rules](https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt-adafruit/blob/master/pxtarget.json#L152) in place to avoid any kind of regression.

The APIs to use the LED ring are on on the ``light`` namespace instead of through ``light.pixels``. This change is very subtle from blocks where the gearwheel is gone. From the JavaScript side, you will see that ``light.pixels.showAnimation(...)`` automatically becomes ``light.showAnimation(...)`` and so forth

Here is the complete list of changes:
```
light.pixels.setAll --> light.setAll
light.pixels.graph --> light.graph
light.pixels.setPixelColor -> light.setPixelColor
light.pixels.pixelColor -> light.pixelColor
light.pixels.pixelColor -> light.pixelColor
light.pixels.setBrightness --> light.setBrightness
light.pixels.photonForward --> light.photonForward
light.pixels.photonFlip --> light.photonFlip
light.pixels.setPhotonColor --> light.setPhotonPenHue
light.pixels.setPhotonMode --> light.setPhotonMode
light.pixels.showAnimation --> light.showAnimation
light.pixels.showAnimationFrame --> light.showAnimation
light.pixels.clear --> light.clear
light.pixels.stopAllAnimations --> light.stopAllAnimations
light.createNeoPixelStrip --> light.createStrip
light.animation(LightAnimation.Rainbow) --> light.rainbowAnimation
light.animation(LightAnimation.RunningLights) --> light.runningLightsAnimation
light.animation(LightAnimation.Comet) --> light.cometAnimation
light.animation(LightAnimation.Sparkle) --> light.sparkleAnimation
light.animation(LightAnimation.TheaterChase) --> light.theaterChaseAnimation
light.animation(LightAnimation.ColorWipe) --> light.colorWipeAnimation
```

## (Under the hood) New build system

The underlying C++ runtiem is now built against the [Lancaster Univerity CODAL](https://github.com/lancaster-university/codal).
