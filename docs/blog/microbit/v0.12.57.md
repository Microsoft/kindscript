**Posted on August 11th, 2017**

This release provides better support for brightness and minor bug fixes.

* release tag: https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt-microbit/releases/tag/v0.12.57

## Brightness in the simulator

The simulator has much better support for rendering LED brightness. Additionally, a new api ``||led:plot brightness||`` was added to control the brightness of LEDs individually.

## Download file name in Safari 10.1 and above

When downloading a file in Safari, it will follow the name of your project rather than ``Download``.

## Colored inline blocks

The blocks rendered in the text are colored using the block information, for example ``||basic:showString||``. [Read the docs](/writing-docs/macros#inlineblocks).
