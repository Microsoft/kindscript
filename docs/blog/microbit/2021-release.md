# MakeCode for the micro:bit – 2021 Release is here!

Phew! We made it through a crazy remote/hybrid school year! And now summer weather + vaccines + the 2021 updates to MakeCode for the micro:bit mean that things are looking up!

Here’s a run-down of the new features in the 2021 release:

* One-click Download – What is the one part of programming the micro:bit that is the biggest pain? If you said dragging-and-dropping program files, you’re not alone! So, we’ve invested even more effort in making WebUSB even easier to use. This new web technology allows you to ‘pair’ USB devices to your web browser, so when you click the Download button, it really does download directly to the micro:bit! You will need the latest firmware on your micro:bit device, and you’ll also need to be using either Edge or Chrome browsers.

* Accessibility – We are continuing to focus on making sure every student has a great experience with MakeCode. For low-vision students, we’ve made some improvements to the color contrasts – most notably in the tutorial interface. And for students with literacy challenges, we’ve added support for Immersive Reader in tutorials. Watch this video to see how it works:

* Updated banner – One of the first things you might notice is a new banner carousel on the home page! There are so many great lessons and resources for the micro:bit, this is a nice way to feature different ones. We also cleaned up the top navigation bar a bit.

* Data logging extension – Now it is possible to collect and store data on the new version of the micro:bit! This is a new extension for MakeCode that allows you to collect data from the micro:bit sensors and record the data on the board. This is helpful if you are running an experiment over a longer period of time or disconnected from a computer. It’s still in Beta, but here’s a short video demonstration:

* Functions with array parameters – Every year we add more functionality to our Functions . This year, we did a small update as a result of your feedback to support array types as parameters.

* Loops updates – When you open up the Loops Toolbox drawer, you may see a couple changes

While loop – we’ve found that “While True” loops can get students into a lot of trouble as infinite loops in their programs! So, we changed the default value to be “false” as a safer way for them to start using this block and set the appropriate conditions for exiting the loop

Every time interval block – this new block is useful for looping on a given time interval (in milliseconds)

Text coding not available in Windows app – Now that one-click downloads are supported with the web version of MakeCode, in this release we are starting the journey to deprecate the Windows 10 app. You will no longer be able to use the text editor in the app, and we will stop updating the app by the 2022 release next June. If you do need full offline access of an app, we recommend using the Offline App here: https://makecode.microbit.org/offline.
