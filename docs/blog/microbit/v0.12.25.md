# Micro:bit Editor v0.12.25

This release introduces migrated the domain name **pxt.microbit.org** to **makecode.microbit.org**
to finalize the migration to the **Microsoft MakeCode** brand.

* release tag: https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt-microbit/releases/tag/v0.12.25

## Do I need to do anything?

You should not have to do anything. The migration will be seamless and all existing **pxt.microbit.org** should be automatically redirected to **makecode.microbit.org**. If you had to unlock the microbit domain, see the [unlocking domains](#domains) section.

## What will happen to my scripts?

When you load the editor in https://makecode.microbit.org, it will automatically import all existing programs under https://pxt.microbit.org . This migration process will happen once per browser.

## What about .hex files?

The program source is attached to each ``.hex`` file. You can drag and drop 
``.hex`` file generated by **pxt.microbit.org** into **makecode.microbit.org**.

## Unlocking domains #domains

The **https://makecode.microbit.org/** should be added to the list of domains to unlock. See the full list at https://pxt.microbit.org/faq .
