## Why Streamer?

"Streaming" is a very popular activity these days where gamers "stream" their gameplay on Twitch.tv and Mixer. Popular streams may have tens of thousands (or more) viewers watching them play. However, they are not just broadcasting; they are also interacting with their audience in various ways. The interaction between the live audience and the artist is one of the reasons streaming is so successul.

Talented streamers have a sophisticated live production environment to remix their webcams, game streams, sounds and live chat. Viewers can triggers events by making donation, vote for outcome of the game, etc...

Streamer aims at bringing some of the production magic of professional streamers into a simple integrated web page. It is designed to simplify the creating of interactive "live" (or recorded) coding sessions.

Streamer allows to seamlessly integrate your webcam feed(s), coding window and streaming chats into a single view.

* optimal screen layout for code editor and/or webcam(s)
