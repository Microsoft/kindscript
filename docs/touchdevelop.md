# FAQ: Touch Develop Shut Down (June 2019)

Microsoft retired the Touch Develop platform in June 2019. Looking for its replacement? See [Microsoft MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com)!

## More information

We have replaced Touch Develop by [Microsoft MakeCode](https://www.makecode.com). At Microsoft, we continually evaluate and invest in building the right tools to help every student learn the computer science skills they need to succeed in the future. We determined we needed to replace Touch Develop with MakeCode in order to provide a more holistic, hands-on computing education platform that will bring computer science to life through physical computing devices like the [micro:bit](https://microbit.org) and immersive experiences like Minecraft. We have built a new games-based curriculum based on [MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com), which supports a new sprite-based game engine.
