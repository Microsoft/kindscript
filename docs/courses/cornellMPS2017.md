# MakeCode for Cornell's Masters of Professional Studies Course

The MakeCode team is sponsoring a project entitled "Customized Coding Experiences for Your Customers"
for students enrolled in Cornell's [Master of Professional Studies in Information Science](http://infosci.cornell.edu/academics/mps).

## Project Description

Today there are many JavaScript libraries for accomplishing just about anything you want on the web, 
but it’s not easy for non-developers (your customers) to harness the power of these libraries. For example, 
augmented reality is all the rage, but not easy to get started with. In this project, you’ll create a programming 
environment for a domain of your choice, using the Microsoft MakeCode platform (www.makecode.com).  
Example domains include:
* Survey: build a survey that is dynamic in nature, requiring conditional control-flow;
* Chat bot: create a chat bot using https://dev.botframework.com/ 
* Business workflow: encode business rules as a program; 
* Formula designer: generate web apps to compute simple equations.
The web site https://ar.pxt.io/ shows a MakeCode environment a graduate student created over the summer of 2017 to 
allow programming of music-making applications based on augmented reality.  

## Activities necessary to achieve the project goal

1.	Find a JavaScript library or web service that aligns with your domain/interests (1 week);
2.	Describe a simplified Application Programming Interface (API) for this library/service using TypeScript (www.typescriptlang.org); 
3.	Configure a new MakeCode editor to surface your API as visual blocks;
4.	Write an interpreter that brings your API to life in the web browser;
5.	Deploy your MakeCode web app and test with your customers.

# Week 1: Getting started with MakeCode

1. Get a [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account, if you don't already have one;
2. Download and install a git client or [GitHub client](https://desktop.github.com); 
3. Download and install [node.js](https://www.nodejs.org);
4. Download and install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), the premier [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) editor;
5. Clone the GitHub repository (repo) at https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-sample to your machine;
6. Follow the directions in the [MakeCode sample](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-sample) to build and run the target.

If you are unfamiliar with the above technologies, spend a little time searching and reading about them.
