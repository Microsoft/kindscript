In order to add more samples: 

Create a folder / category folder under samples, such as basic/hello-world
and create a sample.js file inside of that.

Even though the extension is .js it's actually a Typescript file.

Once you've added the sample in the right spot, configure all.js with your new sample
so it shows up in the dropdown list.
