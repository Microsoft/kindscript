# Writing Docs

PXT allows to bundle documentation as [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) pages
with some additional macros to help with widget formatting.

## File structure

PXT assumes that the documentation is located under the ``/docs`` folder. The web site routing follows the file structure:

```
/about -> /docs/about.md
/reference/math -> /docs/reference/math.md
```

Static assets such as picture can be placed under the ``/docs/static`` folder.

## Macros

The following macros are custom extensions to markdown.

### avatar

    ```
    ### ~avatar [class]

    [content]

    ### ~
    ```
    
See [blink lesson](https://m.pxt.io/lessons/blink/activity) 
and the [markdown source](https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt-microbit/blob/master/docs/lessons/blink/activity.md).

## Inline button rendering

Use `` ``|primary button|`` `` or `` ``||secondary button||`` `` to render a button like element.


## Inline code snippets

If an inline code snippet start with `[` and ends with `]`, the doc engine will try to render it as a block. It must contains a value API call 
to the desired block.

## Code snippets

To avoid screenshot hell, PXT automatically renders code snippets to blocks or javascript. This is done by specifying a language on code blocks.

### dependencies

You need declare the packages required to load your snippet, unless they are part of the default empty template. 
Simple provide a list of package name using the ``package`` macro.

    ```package
    microbit-devices
    microbit-bluetooth
    ```

### blocks

The **blocks** language renders a JavaScript snippet into blocks and provide a simulator if needed.

    ```blocks
    basic.showNumber(5)
    ```
See [forever docs](https://m.pxt.io/reference/basic/show-string) 
and the [markdown source](https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt-microbit/blob/master/docs/reference/basic/forever.md).

### project

The **project** language is similar to blocks but render a published project.

    ```project
    twejlyucio
    ```

### sig

The **sig** displays a signature of the first function call in the snippet.

    ```sig
    basic.showNumber(5)
    ```

See [forever docs](https://m.pxt.io/reference/basic/show-string) 
and the [markdown source](https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt-microbit/blob/master/docs/reference/basic/forever.md).

### cards

The **cards** language displays a code card for each function call.

    ```cards
    basic.showNumber(0);
    basic.showLeds(`
    . . . . .
    . . . . .
    . . # . .
    . . . . .
    . . . . .
    `);
    basic.showString("Hello!");
    basic.clearScreen();
    ````
    
### namespaces

The **namespaces** language display a code card for the first symbol of each namespace.    

    ```namespaces
    basic.showNumber(0);
    input.onButtonPressed(() => {});
    ````
See [basic namespace docs](https://m.pxt.io/reference) 
and the [markdown source](https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt-microbit/blob/master/docs/reference.md).

### block

The **block** language renders a JavaScript snippet into blocks without any simulator.

    ```block
    basic.showNumber(5)
    ```

### javascript

If you need a rendering of typescript, javascript code, specify the language as typescript

    ```typescript
    let x = 0;
    ```

### shuffle

The **shuffle** macro shuffles the blocks from a program which makes for a great student activity.

    ```shuffle
    basic.showNumber(5)
    ```

See [basic namespace docs](https://m.pxt.io/reference/basic) 
and the [markdown source](https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt-microbit/blob/master/docs/reference/basic.md).

### codecard

Renders one or more codecards as JSON into cards

    ```codecard
    [{ 
        "title": "A card", 
        "url": "...." 
    }, {
        "title": "Another card", 
        "url": "...." 
    }]
    ```
  
### ignore

Append `-ignore` to any of the above to ignore a snippet in automated testing:

    ```typescript-ignore
    // You can include illegal TS in here, e.g. to document syntax errors
    callFunction(;
    ```

## Automated testing

Run `pxt snippets` in the project's root directory. This will automatically check that all code
snippets in your documentation can be compiled, and it will check that no typescript features 
that cannot be represented as blocks are used in block snippets.

If you use an additional dependencies, make sure you reference them (see [above](#dependencies)). 

To ensure that a snippet isn't checked, add `-ignore` after the snippet type.
